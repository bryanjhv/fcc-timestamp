# Timestamp Microservice

Solution to FreeCodeCamp's [Timestamp Microservice][fcc-tsms] API Project.


## Background

The goal is to use the [Express][expjs] Node.js web framework to create a simple
API service, which should respond to a `/[timestamp]` endpoint.

The `[timestamp]` can be either a UNIX timestamp (`unix`) or a natural language
date (`natural`).

* **`unix`**: form of `1450137600`.
* **`natural`**: form of `December 15, 2015`.


## Deployment

The project should be deployed in [Heroku][hku] because it's easy to use and
free. Also, [Cloud9 IDE][c9] was suggested for use because it already has all
the needed dependencies ready to work with.
